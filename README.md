# CVE-2024-6387-OpenSSH-Multi-Checker

The `CVE-2024-6387-checker.sh` script is a tool designed to check multiple targets (IPs or hostnames) at once for the CVE-2024-6387 vulnerability. This script performs a local OpenSSH version check, scans remote servers for SSH banners, and determines whether they are vulnerable to CVE-2024-6387. Inspection results are presented in an easy-to-read report.

## Main Features
- **Automatic Installation of nmap**: Ensures `nmap` is installed on the system before scanning.
- **Local OpenSSH Version Scan**: Checks whether the local OpenSSH version is vulnerable.
- **Multiple Target Scanning**: Enables scanning multiple targets at once.
- **Customizable Port Scanning**: Users can specify the ports to scan (default 22).
- **Detailed Report**: Presents a report showing which servers are vulnerable, not vulnerable, or have closed ports.

## How the Script Works
1. **Nmap Installation**: The script checks if `nmap` is installed and tries to install it if it is not found.
2. **Local OpenSSH Version Check**: Checks the OpenSSH version on the local machine and compares it to the list of vulnerable versions.
3. **Remote Server Scan**: Uses `nmap` to get the SSH banner of the target server and check its version.
4. **Vulnerability Identification**: Checks whether the OpenSSH version from the banner is included in the list of vulnerable versions or is excluded.
5. **Reporting**: Presents scan results in an easy-to-read format.

## Script Usage
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
./CVE-2024-6387-checker.sh [options] [target(s)]
